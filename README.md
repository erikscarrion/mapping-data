# Mapping Data in Python
Coursera Lesson 2: Mapping Data to Python

This repository is my submission as part of Week 1 of the Coursera course: [Scripting with Python and SQL for Data Engineering](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python-bash-sql-data-engineering-duke)

## Data
For this exercise, we make use of the wine ratings data in the sample_data folder.

## Purpose of Exercise

After forking the repository and then cloning to a local machine, we perform the following actions: 
1. Import the data using pandas
2. Limit the data to californian red wines with a rating of 90 or better
3. Convert the filtered data frame to a dictionary
4. Save the dictionary as a json file
